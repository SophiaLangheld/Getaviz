## Development Team

### Main Contributors

Getaviz is developed by the research group [Visual Software Analytics](https://home.uni-leipzig.de/svis/) at Leipzig University. It has been developed over several years and is the basic for many scientific publications. In 2018 we released Getaviz as open source to simplify collaboration and practical use of our research prototype. 

Currently, four developers are contributung actively to Getaviz:
* [Richard Müller](https://github.com/rmllr)
* Jan Schilbach
* Pascal Kovacs
* [David Baum](https://www.wifa.uni-leipzig.de/en/information-systems-institute/se/chair/david-baum.html)

Have a look at our [website](https://home.uni-leipzig.de/svis/) for more information about our research group, visualization examples, and our publications. We are looking for collaborations with researchers and developers/companies. If you are interested, please contact us via email.
